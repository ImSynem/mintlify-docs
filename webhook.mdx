description: "Receive POST requests to your URL automatically when an event occurs."
---

Merchants can configure webhook endpoints through their dashboard to receive notifications when specific events occur. When configured events happen, Payvra will send notifications in JSON format with all required information about the transaction, such as the amount and status.

### Setting Up Webhooks

1. Navigate to the Webhooks section in your Payvra dashboard
2. Click "Add Webhook Endpoint"
3. Enter your endpoint URL where you want to receive notifications
4. Select the events you want to subscribe to (e.g., PAYMENT_CREATED, PAYMENT_COMPLETED)
5. Save the webhook configuration to receive your unique Webhook Secret Key

Each webhook endpoint can be configured independently with its own secret key and event subscriptions. You can add multiple endpoints and manage them through the dashboard.

The webhook endpoint must return an HTTP Response 200 with content: ok for Payvra API to confirm the callback as successful. The system will try to deliver a webhook notification up to 5 times or until a successful delivery occurs, whichever happens first. If the first attempt fails, the second one is triggered after approximately 1 minute. The third one is delayed for 3 more minutes, the fourth for 30 minutes, and the last one for 3 hours.

### Webhook Security

Each webhook endpoint has its own `Webhook Secret Key` that's generated when you create the endpoint. This key should be used to validate incoming webhooks using HMAC(sha512) signatures. Payvra sends the signature in the `HMAC` HTTP header of each request.

### Validating Callbacks

Merchants must validate the signature of callbacks coming from Payvra using their `Webhook Secret Key` created when the webhook was set up in the dashboard. Payvra uses your `Webhook Secret Key` as the HMAC shared secret key to generate an HMAC(sha512) signature of the raw POST data. The HMAC signature is sent as an HTTP header called `HMAC`. The body of the request contains the callback data in JSON format, similar to the Payment Information API response body.

### Testing Webhook

For payment callback handling, you can use tools like requestcatcher.com to create a test `endpoint URL` and inspect the callback data sent from Payvra. Note that Payvra payment callbacks will not be sent to private networks (e.g., localhost).

For local debugging, you can use services like https://ngrok.io to expose your local server to the internet and receive webhook callbacks.

**To utilize the payment webhook, please follow these steps:**

1. Create a web server and define an endpoint to handle POST requests.

   - Ensure that the firewall software on your server (e.g., Cloudflare) allows incoming requests from Payvra. You may need to whitelist Payvra's IP addresses on your side. Please reach out to support@payvra.com to obtain the list of IP addresses.

2. Configure your server to receive POST requests at the specified endpoint URL.

   - The POST request body will contain the necessary parameters sent by Payvra in JSON format.

3. Validate the HMAC signature of the request to ensure the authenticity of the callback.

   - Use your `MERCHANT_API_KEY` to calculate the HMAC signature and compare it with the received HMAC header.

4. Process the callback data accordingly based on the status and other parameters provided.

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues you might encounter when implementing webhooks and how to solve them:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not receiving webhook notifications">
    - Ensure your `endpoint URL` is correctly set and accessible from the
    internet. - Check your server's firewall settings to allow incoming requests
    from Payvra. - Verify that your server is responding with a 200 OK status
    and 'ok' message.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Invalid HMAC signature">
    - Double-check that you're using the correct `MERCHANT_API_KEY` or
    `PAYOUT_API_KEY`. - Ensure you're calculating the HMAC signature on the raw
    POST data, not the parsed JSON. - Verify that you're using the SHA-512
    algorithm for HMAC calculation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Webhook timeouts">
    - Optimize your webhook handling code to process requests quickly. -
    Implement asynchronous processing for time-consuming tasks. - Ensure your
    server can handle concurrent webhook requests.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Duplicate webhook notifications">
    - Implement idempotency in your webhook handler to safely process duplicate
    notifications. - Store processed webhook IDs to detect and ignore
    duplicates.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
